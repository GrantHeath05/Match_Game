Unity Engine Match Game Project

This is the GitHub repository for my Unity match game, created in just **24 hours** as a practice project to explore and navigate the Unity Engine.

**Disclaimer**  
Because of the short time frame, this project is not super polished and was built as a fun side experiment. To speed up development, I used some generative AI assistance for portions of the code. The game currently includes a limited set of cards and features, and should be viewed as a quick prototype rather than a finished product.
