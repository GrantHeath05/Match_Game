# Unity Engine Match Game Project

Play the game here: https://wailing-walruses.itch.io/match-game

This is the GitHub repository for my Unity match game, created under a 24‑hour time limit as a practice project to explore the Unity Engine and learn to work under pressure. In the end, the project was completed in roughly 8 hours of work, which includes all pixel art, code, planning, and setup.

## Disclaimer
Because of the short time frame, this project is not highly polished and was built as a fun side experiment. To speed up development, I used some generative AI assistance for portions of the code. The game currently includes a limited set of cards and features, and should be viewed as a quick prototype rather than a finished product.

## Repository Purpose
This repository is provided so anyone interested can explore the code and project file setup.
