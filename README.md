# Unity Engine Match Game Project

Play the game here: https://wailing-walruses.itch.io/match-game

## Overview
This Unity match game was created under a 24‑hour time limit as a practice project.  
Completed in roughly 8 hours, including pixel art, code, planning, and setup.

## Disclaimer
Because of the short time frame, this project is not super polished and was built as a fun side experiment. 
To speed up development, I used some generative AI assistance for portions of the code. The game currently includes a limited set of cards and features, and should be viewed as a quick prototype rather than a finished product.

## Features
- Card matching mechanic
- Custom pixel art assets
- Basic win condition tracking
- Basic main menu system
- Home screen input validation

## What I Learned During This Project
- Became more comfortable with Unity and game engines as a whole
- Gained better understanding of the relationship between GameObjects and Scripts
- Gained experience working under a time constraint

## Repository Purpose
This repository is provided so anyone interested can explore the code and project file setup. This repository is not intended for production use; it is meant for educational purposes only.
